## Known Bugs

_Oh boy, where do I start? The biggest bug was the first folder I worked on. Somehow I deleted everything, I'm not sure if it was the extra branches I made to test index.html page, the way i named gh_pages incorrectly. I made the mistake of deleting the repository then POOOF! everything was messed up. I'm making a copy of the portfolioFix file before I do the gh-pages this time._
